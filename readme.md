# Introduction

Farm to table is an app that is for local farmers trying to find restaurants, grocery stores, and other customers in the area.
Through the process of farmers and restaurants signing up for the service and putting their business on display, customers will be able to browse local food sources near their location


# Next Steps 

* Create a user, farmer, and supplier sign up form.
* Make the feeds of users show local farmers and suppliers.
* Make the feeds of farmers show suppliers to sell to. 
* Convert a farmer and supplier's address to lat and long upon entry using [Google's geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)
    * This is so the app can perform a lookup of distance between lat/long of the user and lat/long of farmers and suppliers
* Allow suppliers to submit buy requests to farmers
* Allow farmers to receive and manage buy requests through the site
